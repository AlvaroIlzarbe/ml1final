        <p>The origins of Pokémon trace back to Satoshi Tajiri's childhood in Machida, Tokyo, where he explored fields and ponds searching for insects and small creatures like tadpoles and crabs. His goal was to collect, study, and classify them in a notebook his parents had given him.</p>
        <p>During his second year of secondary school, Tajiri developed an interest in arcade video games, especially after an arcade opened near his home. This passion continued during his studies at the Tokyo College of Technology in the 1980s, where he frequented arcades in the Shimokitazawa, Shinjuku, and Shibuya neighborhoods.</p>

         </div>
        <p>In March 1983, at the age of seventeen, he launched the first issue of a dōjinshi magazine called Game Freak. The title referenced his fascination with the American film Freaks (1932). The magazine, handwritten by Tajiri, featured video game reviews and guides and was priced at 200 yen.</p>
        <p>Around that time, Tajiri met Tsunekazu Ishihara and manga artist Ken Sugimori, who contributed illustrations to subsequent editions of Game Freak. The magazine ceased publication by the end of the decade.</p>
        <p>With the success of the NES console, Tajiri and Sugimori decided to innovate for the platform. Tajiri transformed Game Freak into a company and developed a puzzle game called Mendel Palace (known in Japan as Quinty), which was released in 1989 and achieved notable success, marking the company's beginnings.</p>
        <p>The following year, they decided to create a game for the Game Boy. Inspired by the Game Link Cable, Tajiri envisioned a game where information could be transferred between consoles. Influenced by franchises like Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest, he created an RPG where monsters could evolve and be transported.</p>
        <p>The project, initially named Capsule Monster, was sent to Nintendo. Tajiri provided the main concept, while Sugimori designed the monsters. They also received advice from Shigeru Miyamoto (creator of Mario Bros.) to improve the game.</p>
        <p>The production lasted five years. During that time, the Game Boy's popularity waned due to a lack of new games, and Game Freak faced financial struggles. Eventually, the project was renamed Pocket Monsters and released in February 1996 with the Aka and Midori ("Red" and "Green") versions. Initially, it was not very successful, but after a year, it surpassed one million copies sold.</p>
        <p>Seeing this, Nintendo decided to bring the series to the Western market. The name was shortened to Pokémon to avoid conflicts with a series called Monster in My Pocket. Pokémon Red and Blue became a hit in the United States, selling over 200,000 copies in their first week.</p>
